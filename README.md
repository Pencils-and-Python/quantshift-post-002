# QuantShift Lab: Pencils & Python Series
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and notebooks for the "Pencils & Python" series, focusing on mathematical and financial concepts in quantitative finance. The series aims to document and share insights on math, modeling, and market concepts through clear explanations and Python-based visualizations.
## Current Post: When Options Have Slope
This notebook explores the derivatives of call and put option payoff functions using visual calculus. The content covers:
- Understanding basic call and put options
- Analyzing option payoff functions at expiration
- Taking derivatives of these payoff functions
- Visualizing the slopes to understand option behavior
- Interpreting what these slopes reveal about option dynamics
